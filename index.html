        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>I am currently a junior at the University of Missouri-Columbia pursuing a bachelor's degree in Computer Science with a minor in Mathematics. I am especially interested in web development. I plan to graduate a semester earlier than my class in December 2020. In my free time I am an avid swing dancer, and I teach free dance lessons at Mizzou as part of the Mizzou Swing Society.</p>
